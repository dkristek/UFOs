# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use HTML and Javascript to create a webpage that hosts a datatable of UFO sighting data and a working filter system.

## Results
There are five different fields that can be used to filter the data. The filters are case and character sensitive. To filter the results, enter a value into the desired filter field and press the enter key. The image below shows the fields and the data table with no filters.

Any combination of the fields can be used to filter the data from one filter to all five filters. The images below show one filter and two filters being used.

## Summary
While the webpage and filter system is functional there are some drawbacks and areas that can be improved. One major drawback is that the filter is case sensitive and sensitive to whitespace. One improvement would be to make the filter insensitive to case and whitespace. A second recommendation for improvement would be to add a button to clear the filters as currently the only way to do this is to manually delete the entry.
